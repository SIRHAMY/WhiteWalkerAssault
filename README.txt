Spring 2014

Dreamt and coded by Hamilton Greene

==========================Background================================
I created this game during the spring semester of 2014 to fulfill the requirements of a homework assignment for CS 2110 (Computer Organization and Programming).  It is by no means a perfect game and some of the code is a mess, but it's what I created in the time frame allotted.  

==========================How to Play===============================
In order to compile and run the game, make sure you have installed all the packages listed in the "Requirements" section of this document.

After you've installed all of the required documents, open a terminal in the same directory as the makefile, header files, and c files (.h and .c).  Type "make vba" in the terminal and a VBA window should pop up displaying the splash screen.

========================The Game=====================================
Defend the realm from the chilly horrors beyond the wall.  Weild your warg powers to hack, slash, and otherwise gobble your opponents in the icy tundra known only as Beyond the Wall.  

Objectives
Keep the White Walkers from reaching the Wall.
Kill 35 to effectively destroy their number.
Don't let 5 reach the Seven Kingdoms.  The powers at war are ill-equipped to handle more.

Controls
Up/Down move Jon Snow
A (z on computer) send out Ghost to bring the Walkers to their knees

===============================Requirements=============================
In order to play the game, you must have the following packages installed

cs-2110-tools and cs-2110-tools-emulator

Both can be found within this repository.  Choose the one that fits your system (i.e. 64 for 64-bit).  You will also find a guide called "GBA tools installation instruction" - follow it.

It should also be mentioned that this setup has only been thoroughly tested on a 64-bit Ubuntu virtual machine, although it has been shown that other systems and setups have been able to run it.  A version of Ubuntu is recommended when attempting to compile and run the game.

It may be possible to run the game using different packages/libraries, but performance may vary.  It is highly recommended that you use the aforementioned libraries when compiling the code to circumvent any unforeseen problems.

================================Credits==============================
Resources provided in this repository owe their existence in large part to the spring 2014 TAs of CS 2110, Bill Leahy (our professor), and Brandon Whitehead (who happens to be a genius at all things computer).

As always, you use this material at your own discretion and are responsible for all risk and damage that may occur.  

Also, don't use this to cheat just because it fulfills your assignment's requirements.  As a reference, it's a valuable resource, but nothing can beat actual coding when it comes to the acquisition and retention of knowledge.

================================Bugs====================================
This is a list of known bugs.  Probably won't ever get around to fixing them, but just in case.

-Multiple Ghosts sent out at the same time
-Random Walker placement not so random
-Can't press multiple buttons at the same time
